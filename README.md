## Installation

### Prerequisites
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev
\`\`\`

### Compilation
\`\`\`bash
gcc main.c shell_functions.c callbacks.c utils.c auto_suggest.c voice_recognition.c -o main `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -lm -lpthread
\`\`\`

### Run
\`\`\`bash
./main
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Auto-Suggestions
1. Start typing a command

**Note**: The current implementation uses simulated voice recognition. For production use, integrate a real speech recognition library like PocketSphinx, Vosk, or Google Speech API.

## Implementing Real Voice Recognition

### Option 1: PocketSphinx (Offline)
\`\`\`bash
sudo apt install libpocketsphinx-dev pocketsphinx-en-us
\`\`\`
Update `voice_recognition.c` to use PocketSphinx API.

### Option 2: Vosk (Offline, Modern)
\`\`\`bash
# Download Vosk library and models from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/
\`\`\`
Integrate Vosk API in `voice_recognition.c`.

### Option 3: Google Speech API (Online)
Use libcurl to send audio to Google Speech API and parse JSON response.

## Built-in Commands
- `cd [path]` - Change directory
- `ls` - List directory contents
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `echo [text]` - Display text
- `cat [file]` - Display file contents
- `calc [expression]` - Calculate arithmetic expressions
- `help [command]` - Show help information

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Enter** - Execute command
- **â†‘/â†“** - Navigate command history (when no suggestions)
