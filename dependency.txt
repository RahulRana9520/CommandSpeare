# Dependencies and compilation instructions

# Install required packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install libpthread-stubs0-dev

# For voice recognition (optional - for production use):
# sudo apt install libpocketsphinx-dev pocketsphinx-en-us
# sudo apt install libvosk-dev

# Compile command:
gcc main.c shell_functions.c callbacks.c utils.c auto_suggest.c voice_recognition.c -o main `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -lm -lpthread

# Run:
./main

# Note: The voice recognition is currently simulated.
# To implement real voice recognition, integrate one of these libraries:
# 1. CMU PocketSphinx (offline, lightweight)
# 2. Vosk (offline, modern, accurate)
# 3. Google Speech API (online, very accurate)
